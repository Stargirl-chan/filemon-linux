   vfs: define struct filename and have getname() return it

   getname() is intended to copy pathname strings from userspace into a
   kernel buffer. The result is just a string in kernel space. It would
   however be quite helpful to be able to attach some ancillary info to
   the string.

   For instance, we could attach some audit-related info to reduce the
   amount of audit-related processing needed. When auditing is enabled,
   we could also call getname() on the string more than once and not
   need to recopy it from userspace.

   This patchset converts the getname()/putname() interfaces to return
   a struct instead of a string. For now, the struct just tracks the
   string in kernel space and the original userland pointer for it.

   Later, we'll add other information to the struct as it becomes
   convenient.

   struct filename {
   const char *name;		/ * pointer to actual string * /
   const __user char *uptr;	/ * original userland pointer * /
   };
